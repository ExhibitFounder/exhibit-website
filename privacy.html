  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="updated">Last updated: February 24, 2026</p>

  <p>Exhibit ("we", "us", or "our") operates the Exhibit: Daily Fit Check mobile application (the "App"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use the App.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

  <h3>Information You Provide</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Account information:</strong> Phone number (for authentication), display name, username, profile photo, and bio.</li>
    <li><strong>Content:</strong> Photos you upload, captions, tags, and comments.</li>
    <li><strong>Messages:</strong> Direct messages and group chat content you send through the App.</li>
    <li><strong>Interactions:</strong> Votes (upvotes/downvotes), favorites, and follows.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Information Collected Automatically</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Location data:</strong> With your permission, we collect your approximate location to power the Nearby feed and Passport feature. Location is encoded as a geohash (a coarse geographic identifier) rather than stored as precise GPS coordinates.</li>
    <li><strong>Device information:</strong> Device type, operating system version, and push notification tokens for delivering notifications.</li>
    <li><strong>Usage data:</strong> Interactions with content (views, votes) used to personalize your Exhibit feed.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide and operate the App's core features (posting, feeds, messaging, notifications).</li>
    <li>Personalize your Exhibit (For You) feed using an on-device taste profile derived from your voting and viewing activity.</li>
    <li>Show relevant nearby content based on your location.</li>
    <li>Send push notifications for follows, votes, comments, and messages (you can disable these in Settings).</li>
    <li>Enforce our community guidelines and moderate content for safety.</li>
    <li>Improve and develop new features.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. How We Share Your Information</h2>
  <p>We do <strong>not</strong> sell your personal information. We may share information in the following limited circumstances:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Public content:</strong> Posts shared to the Exhibit or Nearby feeds are visible to other users. Posts shared to Friends are only visible to mutual friends.</li>
    <li><strong>Service providers:</strong> We use Firebase (Google Cloud) for authentication, data storage, image hosting, and cloud functions. Data is processed in accordance with <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google's privacy policies</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Legal requirements:</strong> We may disclose information if required by law, legal process, or to protect the rights and safety of our users.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
  <p>Your data is stored on Firebase (Google Cloud Platform) servers in the United States. We use Firestore security rules to ensure users can only access data they are authorized to view. Images are stored in Firebase Storage with access controls. All data is transmitted over encrypted (HTTPS/TLS) connections.</p>

  <h2>5. Your Private Archive</h2>
  <p>Every photo you post is saved to your private archive. Only you can see your archived (inactive) posts. When you post a new fit, your previous post is automatically archived from public feeds but remains in your private collection.</p>

  <h2>6. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Location:</strong> You can disable location access in your device settings at any time. The Nearby feed will be unavailable without location permission.</li>
    <li><strong>Notifications:</strong> You can manage notification preferences in the App's settings or disable them in your device settings.</li>
    <li><strong>Account deletion:</strong> You may request deletion of your account and associated data by contacting us at <a href="mailto:ops@joinexhibit.com">ops@joinexhibit.com</a>. We will process deletion requests within 30 days.</li>
    <li><strong>Data access:</strong> You may request a copy of your data by contacting us at the email above.</li>
    <li><strong>Blocking:</strong> You can block other users, which removes all mutual content from feeds and prevents further interaction.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>Exhibit is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we will delete that information promptly.</p>

  <h2>8. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>The App integrates with the following third-party services:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Firebase (Google):</strong> Authentication, database, storage, cloud functions, and push notifications.</li>
    <li><strong>Spotify:</strong> Music search and 30-second preview playback. No Spotify account is required; we use Spotify's public API for search only.</li>
    <li><strong>GIPHY:</strong> GIF search for messaging. Subject to <a href="https://giphy.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GIPHY's privacy policy</a>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of material changes by posting the updated policy in the App or on our website. Your continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
