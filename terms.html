  <h1>Terms &amp; Conditions</h1>
  <p class="updated">Last updated: February 24, 2026</p>

  <p>These Terms and Conditions ("Terms") govern your use of the Exhibit: Daily Fit Check mobile application ("App") operated by Exhibit ("we", "us", or "our"). By downloading, installing, or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms.</p>

  <h2>1. Eligibility</h2>

  </ul>

  <h2>3. User Content</h2>

  <h3>Your Content</h3>
  <p>You retain ownership of the photos, captions, and other content ("User Content") you post on the App. By posting User Content, you grant us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide license to use, display, and distribute your User Content within the App for the purpose of operating and improving the service.</p>

  <p>We reserve the right to remove any content that violates these guidelines and to suspend or terminate accounts of repeat offenders.</p>

  <h2>4. The One-Active-Fit Rule</h2>
  <p>Exhibit operates on a "one active fit" model. When you post a new outfit, your previous post is automatically archived from public feeds. Archived posts remain visible only to you in your private archive. This is by design and is a core feature of the App.</p>

  <h2>5. Acceptable Use</h2>

  <h2>7. Intellectual Property</h2>
  <p>The App, including its design, features, code, and branding (excluding User Content), is owned by Exhibit and is protected by intellectual property laws. You may not copy, modify, distribute, or create derivative works based on the App without our written permission.</p>

  <h2>8. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>The App may integrate with third-party services (such as Spotify for music and GIPHY for GIFs). Your use of these features is subject to the respective third-party terms of service. We are not responsible for the content, privacy practices, or availability of third-party services.</p>

  <h2>9. Disclaimers</h2>
  <p>The App is provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind, either express or implied. We do not guarantee that the App will be uninterrupted, secure, or error-free. We are not responsible for User Content posted by other users.</p>

  <h2>10. Limitation of Liability</h2>

You may delete your account at any time by contacting us at <a href="mailto:ops@joinexhibit.com">ops@joinexhibit.com</a>. Upon termination, your right to use the App ceases immediately.</p>

  <h2>12. Changes to These Terms</h2>
  <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. We will notify you of material changes by posting the updated Terms in the App or on our website. Your continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>
