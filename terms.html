  </ul>
  <p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate any account that violates these Terms or that we reasonably believe to be fraudulent.</p>

  <h2 id="user-content">3. User Content</h2>

  <h3>Ownership</h3>
  <p>You retain full ownership of the photos, captions, tags, comments, and other content ("User Content") you create and post on the App.</p>

  <h3>License Grant</h3>
  <p>By posting User Content, you grant Exhibit a non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide, transferable, sublicensable license to use, host, store, display, reproduce, modify (for formatting and technical purposes only), and distribute your User Content solely for the purposes of operating, providing, improving, and promoting the App. This license continues until your User Content is deleted from our systems, either by you or upon account deletion.</p>

  <h3>Your Representations</h3>
  <p>By posting User Content, you represent and warrant that:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You own the content or have all necessary rights and permissions to post it.</li>
    <li>Your content does not infringe, misappropriate, or violate any third party's intellectual property, privacy, or other rights.</li>
    <li>Your content complies with these Terms and all applicable laws.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="content-guidelines">4. Content Guidelines</h2>
  <p>Exhibit is a fashion and outfit-sharing community. You agree not to post content that:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Is illegal, harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing, defamatory, or obscene.</li>
    <li>Contains nudity, sexually explicit material, or graphic violence.</li>
    <li>Promotes violence, discrimination, hatred, or harassment against any individual or group.</li>
    <li>Is designed to bully, intimidate, or demean other users.</li>
    <li>Infringes on the intellectual property rights of others.</li>
    <li>Contains spam, unauthorized advertising, solicitations, or promotional material.</li>
    <li>Includes malware, viruses, or any harmful or malicious code.</li>
    <li>Misrepresents your identity, affiliation, or the origin of the content.</li>
    <li>Contains personal or confidential information of another person without their consent.</li>
    <li>Encourages or facilitates any illegal activity.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We reserve the right to remove any content that violates these guidelines at our sole discretion, with or without notice, and to suspend or permanently terminate the accounts of repeat offenders.</p>

  <h2 id="one-fit">5. The One-Active-Fit Rule</h2>
  <p>Exhibit operates on a "one active fit" model, which is a core feature of the App:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Each user may have only one active (publicly visible) outfit post at any time.</li>
    <li>When you post a new outfit, your previous active post is automatically archived from public feeds.</li>
    <li>Active posts expire after 24 hours and are automatically archived.</li>
    <li>Archived posts remain accessible only to you in your private archive.</li>
    <li>This behavior is intentional by design and cannot be overridden.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="feeds">6. Feeds &amp; Content Discovery</h2>
  <p>The App provides three content feeds for discovering outfits:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Friends Feed:</strong> Shows active posts from users you follow who also follow you back (mutual friends).</li>
    <li><strong>Exhibit (For You) Feed:</strong> A personalized feed that ranks and surfaces content based on your engagement patterns, including your voting history, viewing behavior, and content preferences. This personalization is powered by a taste profile that is automatically generated and updated as you use the App.</li>
    <li><strong>Nearby Feed:</strong> Shows active posts from users in your geographic area (approximately 25-mile radius), based on your device's location data.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>When posting, you can choose which feeds your outfit appears in (Friends, Exhibit, Nearby, or any combination). Feed algorithms and ranking may change at any time without notice as we improve the App.</p>

  <h2 id="interactions">7. Social Interactions</h2>
  <p>The App enables the following social features:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Following:</strong> You may follow other users. When two users follow each other, they become mutual friends.</li>
    <li><strong>Voting:</strong> You may upvote or downvote posts. Votes influence content ranking in the Exhibit feed and contribute to a poster's upvote count displayed on their profile.</li>
    <li><strong>Comments:</strong> You may post comments on other users' active posts. Comments must comply with our Content Guidelines. We reserve the right to remove comments that violate these Terms.</li>
    <li><strong>Posting Streak:</strong> The App tracks consecutive days on which you post an outfit. Streaks are displayed on your profile and reset if you miss a day.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="messaging">8. Messaging</h2>
  <p>The App provides direct messaging, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>One-on-one chats:</strong> Private conversations between two users.</li>
    <li><strong>Group chats:</strong> Conversations involving multiple users.</li>
    <li><strong>Media sharing:</strong> You may share images and GIFs within messages.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>All messages are subject to our Content Guidelines. You agree not to use messaging to harass, spam, or send unsolicited content to other users. We do not actively monitor private messages, but we may review reported messages to enforce these Terms.</p>

  <h2 id="location">9. Location Services &amp; Passport</h2>
  <p>Certain features of the App require access to your device's location:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Nearby Feed:</strong> Uses your device's GPS to show posts from users in your geographic area. Location data is encoded as a geohash for privacy and queried at reduced precision (approximately city-level).</li>
    <li><strong>Passport:</strong> Allows you to virtually set your location to browse the Nearby feed in other areas. Passport locations are stored locally on your device and are reduced to approximately 1.1 km precision.</li>
    <li><strong>Post Location:</strong> If you post to the Nearby feed, your post's approximate location is stored to enable geographic discovery.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>You may disable location permissions at any time in your device settings, but the Nearby feed and related features will not function without location access. For more information on how we handle location data, please refer to our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

  <h2 id="music">10. Music Integration</h2>
  <p>The App integrates with Spotify to allow you to attach music to your outfit posts:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You may search for and attach songs to your posts, which will display the track name, artist, and album artwork.</li>
    <li>Music previews (up to 30 seconds) may be played by other users viewing your post.</li>
    <li>This integration uses the Spotify Web API and does not require you to have a Spotify account.</li>
    <li>Music content is provided by Spotify and is subject to <a href="https://www.spotify.com/legal/end-user-agreement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spotify's Terms of Use</a>. We do not own or control the music content available through this integration.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="gifs">11. GIF Integration</h2>
  <p>The App integrates with GIPHY to allow you to send GIFs in messages:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>GIF content is provided by GIPHY and is subject to <a href="https://giphy.com/terms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GIPHY's Terms of Service</a>.</li>
    <li>We do not own, host, or control the GIF content available through this integration.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="outfit-search">12. Outfit Search &amp; Detection</h2>
  <p>The App may offer features that use computer vision technology to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Detect clothing items in your outfit photos.</li>
    <li>Search for similar clothing items or outfits.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These features use Google Cloud AI services. By using outfit search and detection, you consent to your outfit photos being processed by these services for the purpose of identifying and matching clothing items. No facial recognition is performed. These features may not be available at all times and their accuracy is not guaranteed.</p>

  <h2 id="notifications">13. Push Notifications</h2>
  <p>The App may send you push notifications about activity related to your account, including new followers, votes, comments, messages, and other interactions. You can manage or disable push notifications at any time through your device settings or the in-app notification preferences.</p>

  <h2 id="moderation">14. Content Moderation</h2>
  <p>We use automated content moderation systems, including Google Cloud Vision SafeSearch, to detect and flag content that may violate our Content Guidelines, such as nudity or explicit material. Content flagged by our moderation systems may be:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Automatically removed or hidden from public feeds.</li>
    <li>Manually reviewed by our team.</li>
    <li>Result in account suspension or termination for repeat violations.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Automated moderation is not perfect and may occasionally flag content incorrectly. If you believe your content was wrongly removed, you may contact us at <a href="mailto:ops@joinexhibit.com">ops@joinexhibit.com</a> to request a review.</p>

  <h2 id="blocking">15. Blocking &amp; Reporting</h2>
  <p>You may block other users at any time. When you block a user:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>They will no longer be able to see your posts, profile, or send you messages.</li>
    <li>Their content will be hidden from your feeds.</li>
    <li>Any existing follow relationships between you will be removed.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>You may unblock a user at any time from your settings. If you encounter content or behavior that violates these Terms, we encourage you to report it to us at <a href="mailto:ops@joinexhibit.com">ops@joinexhibit.com</a>.</p>

  <h2 id="acceptable-use">16. Acceptable Use</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Use the App for any unlawful or unauthorized purpose.</li>
